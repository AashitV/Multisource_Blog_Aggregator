!! WARNING !! : *This is a web scrapping project and should not be used against websites/webpages which do not want their resources to be scrapped.*

-> THIS PROJECT USES SEVERAL PYTHON LIBRARIES; GOAL IS TO HAVE DAILY BLOGS/ARTICLES AT A CENTRALIZED SPACE FROM DIFFERENT WEBSITES.

-> There's a seperate python file for each websites that are scrapped, which includes specific selectors for fetching titles with respective links to route.

-> Hence, can add multiple websites by this strategy, all in one index.py file.
